## Security Notes

- Reentrancy guarantees and Soroban execution-model assumptions are documented in [`REENTRANCY.md`](./REENTRANCY.md).

## Reserve Income Analytics

- Reserve accrual is treated as protocol income.
- On each reserve accrual, protocol analytics are synchronized so:
	- `total_value_locked` increases by the accrued reserve amount.
	- cumulative `protocol_revenue` increases by the same amount.
- On reserve withdrawal to treasury:
	- `total_value_locked` decreases by the withdrawn reserve amount.
	- cumulative `protocol_revenue` is unchanged (it remains historical income).

### Trust Boundaries

- Admin powers:
	- can set reserve factor (bounded to 0..5000 bps).
	- can set treasury destination.
	- can withdraw only accrued reserve balances.
- Guardian powers are unchanged by reserve analytics and remain in recovery/governance flows.

### Token Transfer and Reentrancy

- Reserve withdrawal follows checks-effects-interactions: storage is updated before external token transfer.
- External transfers use Soroban token client and remain behind admin authorization.
- Arithmetic for TVL/revenue synchronization uses checked operations and fails on overflow.
